    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will explore the process of building a customer churn prediction app with Gradio, a Python library that allows you to quickly create customizable UIs for your machine learning models. We will walk through the steps of collecting and preparing the input data and integrating an already built classification model into the Gradio interface. This project provides a practical example of how Gradio can be used to create user-friendly machine learning applications.\n",

    "### 1.1 Overview of customer churn prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn prediction is the process of using machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn. By analyzing customer behavior and demographic data, patterns and trends can be identified to predict churn. Predictive models can be trained on historical customer data to predict the likelihood of churn for new customers. Identifying customers who are at high risk of churning allows companies to take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering loyalty programs, discounts, or personalized recommendations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Preparing the Model for Deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 1 Overview of the existing churn prediction model\n",
    "\n",
    "The existing prediction model, which will be embedded in this app, is a classification model that categorizes customers as ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, where ‚ÄúYes‚Äù indicates that the customer is likely to churn, and ‚ÄúNo‚Äù means that they are not. The model utilizes 24 features to make its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Converting the churn prediction model, pipeline and other features to a format that can be deployed with Gradio\n",
    "\n",
    "After training and fine-tuning the model, the best-performing model was selected. A higher weight was given to the model‚Äôs ability to accurately classify customers who are likely to churn rather than its precision. The model, pipeline, and other components were saved as pickle files and will be used later to construct the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save the model and the columntransformer\n",
    "\n",
    "import pickle \n",
    "filename = 'logistic_reg_class_model.pkl'\n",

    "pickle.dump(logistic_bayes_search.best_estimator_, open(filename, 'wb'))\n",
    "pickle.dump(full_pipeline, open(filename_2, 'wb'))\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Exporting model/app dependencies and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification model that was built used specific modules and frameworks. To embed the model into the app in a separate environment and ensure that the app runs correctly without any version conflicts between these modules and frameworks, the same versions of these modules and frameworks must be installed in the environment. The session_info library was utilized to obtain the names and exact versions of these frameworks and modules from our Jupyter notebook. To utilize the session_info library:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Building the App\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Setting up an Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a Python environment is an essential step when building machine learning apps with Gradio. A Python environment is a self-contained space where you can install Python packages and dependencies without affecting the global Python installation on your system. This ensures that your app has access to the correct versions of the required libraries and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradio_venv environment was created using the venv module in Python. First, navigate to your base folder, which will contain our app, in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a python environment in Windows/MacOs/Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -m venv gradio_venv\n",
    "To activate the environment on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "gradio_venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "To activate the environment on Linus or MacOs\n",
    "\n",
    "source streamlit_venv/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 2 Installing dependencies and requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up and activating the environment, the app‚Äôs requirements and dependencies are installed to ensure that the model has the same dependencies and requirements used during its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "First install Gradio using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install gradio\n",
    "Secondly install the requirement and dependencies saved in the requiremet.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install -r requirement.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 3 Creating the App Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradio provides two methods for creating interfaces: Gradio‚Äôs default interface and Gradio‚Äôs blocks. In this case, Gradio‚Äôs blocks were used to gain more control over the app‚Äôs interface compared to the default interface, which has a predefined format. The app‚Äôs interface consists of three parts: inputs, outputs, and a button to run the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input fields, dropdown, radio buttons, and number fields were utilized. The dropdown widget was used for features such as Gender, Contract, and InternetService. Radio buttons were used for OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, PaperlessBilling, PhoneService, and MultipleLines. The number widget was employed for MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Tenure, and PaymentMethod.\n",

    "2. The code was made successfully captured an error that arose from the pipeline‚Äôs inability to process None values. To display a custom error message, the gradio.error method was utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 Testing the App with several Data\n",
    "\n",
    "During the development of the app, I performed several tests using different input values to ensure that the app was working as expected. Each time, the churning probabilities were calculated and displayed correctly. It is worth noting that these tests were conducted locally on my machine and the app was not deployed to a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conclusion and Further Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the entire code for this Gradio app on my GitHub page. I am passionate about Data Analysis, Data Science and Machine Learning, and I am always eager to learn from others and share my knowledge. If you follow me on GitHub, you will gain access to more of my work and receive regular updates.
